                <p class="blogCopy">You know, they say that stealing is an art.</p>

                <p class="blogCopy">Let's just think about it for a second. Let's remove all moral and legal implications that the word 'stealing' carries with it and just analyze the act for what it truly is. Think about it. To steal, one must first understand. If one were planning to steal a million dollars, for example, that person would need to thoroughly understand the fluctuating parameters that revolve around those million dollars. Where is the money housed? Who is guarding it? How does the money get there in the first place? Will the money be looked over at any point? These are questions that ultimately help device the plan of attack. With this in mind, isn't stealing truly an art? One not only focuses on tangible hurdles, but the metaphysical ones as well. How will the guard experience the least amount of disturbance? What will the decoy be so as to ensure a credible scenario? Take all these factors into question and stealing, I think, takes more than the will to take forceful ownership of an object; it involves mastering the objects and situations around you.</p>

                <p class="blogCopy">Let's bring the focus to my field of practice, Design. Stealing a design is strictly impermissible in the community, and I am not about to start a debate. But, what if you were to learn from stealing another design? I mean, hell, Picasso even said it, "Bad artists copy. Good artists steal." I think it goes without saying that stealing a design should never be used for commercial purposes. I believe that degrades the work of the designer and/or agency in question. But we can sure as hell learn from it. I think one of the obstacles that this faces is honesty. Be open about what you are doing. Be humble to accept the fact that you admired someone else's work and have become obsessed to the point where you want to adopt it as your own. Your designs are not the best. If you enter the door with the latter mindset, stealing is immediately seen as an opportunity, and not a detriment to society.</p>

                <p class="blogCopy">I admit that I became blown away by <a href="http://lifeingreenville.com/">Life In Greenville</a>'s website and design. I became jealous about the fact I didn't think about subtly curving the navigation bar. The full-size images immediately stirred an emotional response within me, and it became natural to begin loving the experience the website provides. Instead of copying their design and commercially appropriating it, I decided to do something more unique. I deglossed their website. I opened up <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview">Developer Tools</a> and began studying each and every CSS declaration. I questioned their semantic HTML. And I became enlightened.</p>

                <p class="blogCopy">Eureka moments in this field seem to erupt like daisies on a warm spring day. But how many Eureka moments do you personally have? They probably seem more like solar eclipses, right? Often we find ourselves creatively blocked, trying to find the best way to represent something visually. But what I experienced was far more inspiring than bluntly copying or stealing. What I experienced were a plethora of Eureka moments. I understood why the developers behind Life in Greenville made certain programmatic decisions, and I learned from it. It was almost as if they became my mentors for those two days I spent learning their mastery behind Life in Greenville.

                <p class="blogCopy">My point behind all of this is to enhance trust and honesty within our industry. Let's be open about what we do. Let's be humble and openly admire the work of others. Let's be happy to be working with individuals that are true masters in their field. Let's be even more proud of the advances in technology this practice has given society. </p>

                <p class="blogCopy">Don't copy, don't steal. Adapt, learn, and make better.</p>

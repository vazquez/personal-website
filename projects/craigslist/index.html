                <h1>UI/UX Thoughts</h1>
                <hr/>
                <h4>Our vision is optimized to see structure. One of the biggest factors affecting the present Craigslist website is that there is no Gestalt principle being sought after by the eye. I have chosen to visually group boxes with visible and metaphysically constructed borders in order to induce the website with the Gestalt principle of Proximity. Due to the fact that our mind's visual system tries to enclose every open element, I have used strict lines and columns to aid the eye in closing every section off, thus providing closure to the content.
                <br><br>
                Hierarchy is employed in this concept by giving sole focus to the search bar. In a website that is meant to provide information clearly and effectively, a search function must be prominent. Additionally, visual hierachy allows users to separate what is relevant to their goals from what is instantly irrelevant. By providing the user with a prominent search bar, it is my hope that the website will experience a decrease in bounce rates.
                <br><br>
                The Breadcrumb present within the Post.html page is one that strives to be unobstrusive but informative. Only content that is relevant should be highlighted to the user. It is because of this that the past breacrumb items are not highlighted in full white; only the active breadcrumb page has full opacity. This UI decision comes from recognizing the importance of having just the right information presented in a clear and modest manner.


                </h4>

            <div class="eight columns">
                <h4>UI Design is deeply aware that individuals are programmed for language, but not for reading. Due to the latter, when a  design is purely textual, it becomes challenging to invite the eye to read on. I have found that by providing visual feedback to the Classifieds list items, I am able to keep the eye interested and engaged. Furthermore, I have also accounted for colour-blind users, as I am providing a structural feedback by underlining the text when the user hovers in addition to it changing colour. Usually, I would have added a zebra striping to every odd line item to create structure to the text. However, I found that this approach degraded the quality of simplicity that I was aiming to achieve.
                <br><br>
                By making the body of the webpage solid white, I am not interfering with the content. Additionally, on a UX perspective, I wanted to subtly reminisce the days of printed classifieds. The structure that I provide hints at the modernist days of mass consumption. Even though a webpage is this generation's 'newspaper', when we are faced with typographic layouts it is important to historically refer to print design to drive the UX forward. The user will subsconsciously feel at home; s/he will feel unintruded and frustration will be minimal.
                <br><br>
                Due to the differences between a user's short vs. long-term memory, I am hoping that the user will not remember the content present within the website (as it can change anytime), but rather remember the actions they were able to perform and the level of visual clarity the website provided. Often times, I find myself coming back to a website due to the feeling of unobstructed behaviour it left within me.
